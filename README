Run solve.sh to solve my kids' Cat Crimes logic game Expert #40 puzzle.  

Sheesh:
I couldn't figure out how to write it in Prolog (it's been too long)
I couldn't use a truth table without getting confused or having to write out all 720 options (no thanks)
I couldn't use a logic puzzle 2D grid - didn't even know where to start
I couldn't even write it well in Python, it wasn't amenable to it
I had to fall back on bash and a whole lot of ugly regexps
The ugliest of which was expressing "Two cats are across from each other"

And even THEN I couldn't get it to work without debugging it, as my grep fu is old
(I kept forgetting when I had to use egrep instead of just grep)
And so I had to cheat and enter the correct answer as input to figure out why the greps were broken

Cat Crimes kicked my butt.
